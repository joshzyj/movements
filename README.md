Movements Model
==============

This is a simple ABM of the effect of the Internet on social movement
formation. 

I am developing it as part of my thesis.

Different social mechanisms and media platforms will be added over time.

You can always find the latest working version in this repository, and
a [live demo here](http://wybowiersma.net/movements/)

Installation
--------------

There is no need to install anything if you just want to run 
or edit the model.

If you want to make changes to Agentscript you need to remove the
agentscript directory, and then:

    git clone git@github.com:wybo/agentscript.git
    cd agentscript
    npm install

To then edit/change AgentScript (in agentscript/src) run:

cake watch (from the agentscript dir)
