There is no need to install anything if you just want to run 
or edit the model.

If you want to make changes to Agentscript you need to remove the
agentscript directory, and then:

git clone git@github.com:wybo/agentscript.git
cd agentscript
npm install

To then edit/change AgentScript (in agentscript/src) run:

cake watch (from the agentscript dir)
